Bugs:
- Friction should decrease velocity
- Fuzzy GLUT text in Windows
- GameObj._setBody needs to destroy old body
- Why doesn't camera centering work perfectly?
- Put the division fix into all modules
- DCameraLead gets shakey when framerate dips (try with profiling to see)
- Get ui.msecs from the main loop in app (better yet, vice versa)

Short term features:
- DSprite should use step for advancement, not draw (so we can use sprite for timing)
- Joint system needs to make more sense
- Use TrackerList for drives that have sub-objects (limb manager, drive.DSubObjs, etc)
- Simple camera like NSMB (force Satyrn to stay inside box 1/6 of screensize)
- Make console 'help()' work better
- Magnets also move magnet towards pulled object
- Antialiasing
- Options dialog, saving options
- Changing resolution/fullscreen state (Windows and Linux)
- Level loading
- Control mapping
- Gamepad support
- HUD, real FPS display
- Level testing architecture
- Unit tests for modules
- For checking draw clipping, have another Drive method
- Derive body/geom (scaling, 2d, angle conversion)

Long term features:
- Level editor w/ carefully designed palette
- Particles
- Tutorial & test levels
- Lighting effects
- Sound
- Ropes and chains
- Windows launcher (maybe self-contained binary)

Design notes:
- Don't have Drive in one GameObj keep refs to other Drives; refs to GameObjs instead

----
Theoretical Controller Configuration:
Gamepad with 6 buttons and stick or d-pad:
 L     R
 |     A
---   B C
 |     D

Ground movement:
D: Jump
Stick away from ground: Stand
Stick towards ground: Crouch/add extra friction when sliding
Stick parallel to ground: Walk/crawl

Air movement:
Stick: Slow drift (only available to the degree that you've already got velocity, and it lowers total velocity)

Pulsing:
Tap B: Pulse to stop motion (if already still, just a waste of energy)
Tap B + Direction: Pulse
Hold B, Release B (+ optional direction): Charged pulse
Hold B, Push A: Cancel pulse charge

Sword:
Tap C (+ optional direction, defaults to facing/vel direction): Sword attack
Hold C, Release (+ optional direction): Charged sword attack
Hold C, Push A: Cancel sword charge

Interaction:
A (+ optional direction, defaults to nearest interactable object): Grab
A while holding object: Drop object (release with no force)
Hold A while holding object, release A (+ optional direction, defaults to facing direction): Throw held object

Magnets and Gravity:
L: Blue magnetic field
R: Red magnetic field
L+R Hold (1sec): Toggle anti-grav field
