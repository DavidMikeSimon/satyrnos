Bugs:
- Friction should decrease velocity
- Fuzzy GLUT text in Windows
- GameObj._setBody needs to destroy old body
- Magnets also move magnet towards pulled object
- Does CBoxMag rotation work?

Short term features:
- TrackerList
- Options dialog, saving options
- Changing resolution/fullscreen state (Windows and Linux)
- Collide2 (and maybe contact groups) to decrease spurious collisions
- CLineMag
- Object and controller specialized sequence derivatives
- Level loading
- Control mapping
- Gamepad support
- Debug watcher boxes
- HUD, FPS display
- Level testing architecture
- Unit tests for modules
- One GameObj, many Drawer types
- For checking draw clipping, use Drawers
- Derive body/geom (scaling, 2d, angle conversion)

Long term features:
- Level editor w/ carefully designed palette
- Limb animation
- Particles
- Lighting effects
- Sound
- Windows launcher (maybe self-contained binary)

Design notes:
- Associate Controllers with Drawers in same GameObj by keeping Drawers in a TrackerList
- Don't have Controllers in one GameObj keep refs to other Controllers; refs to GameObjs instead

Theoretical Controller Configuration:
Gamepad with 6 buttons and stick or d-pad:
 L     R
 |     A
---   B C
 |     D

Ground movement:
D: Jump
Stick away from ground: Stand
Stick towards ground: Crouch/add extra friction when sliding
Stick parallel to ground: Walk/crawl

Air movement:
Hold D: Prepare for jump (if release as hit the ground, quickly hops off again)
Stick: Slow drift (only available to the degree that you've already got velocity, and it lowers total velocity)

Pulsing:
Tap B: Pulse to check motion (if already still, just a waste of energy)
Tap B + Direction: Pulse
Hold B, Release B (+ optional direction): Charged pulse
Hold B, Push C: Cancel pulse charge

Sword:
Tap C (+ optional direction, defaults to facing/vel direction): Sword attack
Hold C, Release (+ optional direction): Charged sword attack
Hold C, Push B: Cancel sword charge

Interaction:
A (+ optional direction, defaults to nearest interactable object): Grab
A while holding object (and no interactable objects near): Drop object (release with very mild force)
Hold A while holding object, release A (+ optional direction, defaults to facing direction): Throw held object

Magnets and Gravity:
L: Blue magnetic field
R: Red magnetic field
L+R Hold (1sec): Toggle anti-grav field
